# Simple Word Counter using Js

A word counter project in JavaScript is an application that allows users to input text and count the number of words in the text. This project is useful for a variety of purposes, such as checking the length of a words, counting character limit, and providing feedback on writing assignments.

To create a word counter project in JavaScript, you would typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The HTML code would provide the structure of the project, including the text input box that shows words and character count and the button to restart the process. The CSS code would be used to style the appearance of the project. The JavaScript code would be used to perform the word counting functionality, which involves splitting the text into individual words and counting the number of words.
